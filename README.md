## Terraform Backend Configuration

Since it is common to use the Terraform CLI alongside Terraform Cloud, Hashicorp recommends including a backend block in the configuration code. Backend configuration is only used by the CLI.

See [Where Backends Are Used](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/index.html#where-backends-are-used).
